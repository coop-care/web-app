<h1 class="website__hidden">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p>
<p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
<p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
<p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III. Information about the data processing<br>IV. General notes</p>

<h2>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h2>
<p>The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:</p>
<p>Michael Kamphausen<br>Friedrich-List-Str. 2d<br>21079 Hamburg<br>Germany</p>
<p>E-Mail: &#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#64;&#99;&#111;&#111;&#112;&#99;&#97;&#114;&#101;&#46;&#100;&#101;</p>

<h2>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h2>
<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
<li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
<li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 GDPR), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
<li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
<li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
<p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>

<h2>III. Information about the data processing</h2>
<p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

<h3>Server data</h3>
<p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
<p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
<p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
<p>The data will be deleted within no more than 14 days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>

<h3>CoopCare App</h3>

<h3>User account / registration</h3>
<p>If you create a user account with us via our app, we will collect and store the data you enter during registration (e.g. your name or e-mail address) exclusively for pre-contractual services, for contract fulfilment or for the purpose of customer care. We also store the date and time of your registration. This data will not be transferred to third parties.</p>
<p>During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide your user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for this processing.</p>
<p>If the opening of the user account is also intended to lead to the initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
<p>You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
<p>The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary. However, we must observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial law.</p>

<h4>Patient data</h4>
<p>If you enter data about your patients in our CoopCare app, including data about your patients' health, your patients will also be affected by data processing in CoopCare. We collect and store the patient data entered by you exclusively for pre-contractual services or for the fulfilment of the contract so that you can fulfil your legal obligations to document the care of your patients and your operational and organisational requirements for planning care. At the same time, we store the date and time of each processing of the data and which user carried out this processing, so that each processing of the documentation and planning can be traced by you in accordance with the legal and organizational requirements.</p>
<p>If the patients concerned have consented to the processing, the legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>
<p>If the processing of patient data is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract or pre-contractual measures between you and your patients, this processing takes place on the legal basis pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
<p>If the processing is necessary to fulfil your legal obligations, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c) is the legal basis of the processing.</p>
<p>If the vital interests of the patients concerned are protected by the nursing documentation and planning, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. d) GDPR is also the legal basis for this processing.</p>
<p>The processed patient data can be viewed, corrected and, if processing is no longer required, deleted at any time in the app CoopCare.</p>

<h4>MongoDB Stitch</h4>
<p>For the storage of the data entered in the app CoopCare via the registration function, as well as the patient data entered by you for care documentation and planning, we use the internet service Stitch from MongoDB Inc.. This is an internet service that provides a database with registration function and access rights management. The service provider's server used by us is located in Germany. The legal basis for the use of MongoDB Stitch to store data is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. MongoDB offers further privacy information at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Encrypted data transmission</h4>
<p>Both the communication between your browser and our web server from which you retrieve the CoopCare app and between the CoopCare app in your browser and the database of the MongoDB Stitch service are encrypted using SSL or TLS encryption, so that the transmitted data cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<h4>Cookies, Local Storage and Session Storage</h4>
<p>We use the so-called Local Storage in the CoopCare app. This is a storage technology by which text information is stored in the Internet browser you use on your device. This text information is used to process and store your login status and your signature mark, making our app more user-friendly, effective and secure.</p>
<p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as this data is used to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
<p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our app. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
<p>You can refuse the use of cookies, local or session storage by changing the settings of your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete data that has already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support.</p>
<p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, local or session storage, not all of the functions on our app may be fully usable.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
<p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>
