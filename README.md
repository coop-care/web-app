# CoopCare

We relieve nurses in documentation and planning by using the Omaha System and support care teams in cooperation and in strengthening their clients.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

**Important note: we are currently undergoing a major rebuild of CoopCare's foundation to provide offline capability and end-to-end encryption in data synchronization. Until the transition to the new system is ready, starting the app in development mode and building the app for production will temporarily not work.**

### Start the app in development mode

Including hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
